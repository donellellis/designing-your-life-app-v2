# Designing Your Life: Companion App

The Designing Your Life: Companion App is a web-based workbook for Bill Burnett and David Evans’s book, Designing Your Life. It is a digital resource for readers to record and update their responses to the book’s exercises. The app guides a user through the process of creating a Health/Work/Play/Love Dashboard where they can assess where they are and add commentary.
